# scMINER cell clustering benchmark scripts

## Clustering_HPC
Clustering scripts for MICA,Seurat,SC3s,scVI,scDeepCluster and HPC bash job submission scripts.


## Benchmark_ARI_metrics
Codes for true-label-based metrics, i.e., ARI, AMI, NMI, ASW, Accuracy, Purity.

## Benchmark_large_datasets
Codes for one-shot running time and max memory usage.

## Benchmark_MICA_parameters
Codes for evaluation of MICA MDS & GE key parameters, i.e. MI bin size, components of reduced dimensions, Louvain resolution.


## Activity_based_clustering
Codes for activity-based clustering evaluation with activity calculated by scMINER,SCENIC in PBMC14K, Treg, Tex datasets.
Clustering is done by MICA PCA mode. 

## PBMC14K
HVG and Louvain/Leiden resolution sweeping for PBMC14K.
